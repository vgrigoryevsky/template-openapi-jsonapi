# Template OpenAPI JSON:API-compliant 

This is template for the [OpenAPI Specification](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html).

It's also compliant with the [JSON:API Specification](https://jsonapi.org/). 

Fork it and save some time setting up new OpenAPI repo.

Replace `template` with the name of the project/ service/ app.

Replace `object` with the name of the entity you're modelling. 

Don't change `baseObject` (at least until you understand what it's used for).
